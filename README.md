# Sony-Vaio-SVE14-Hackintosh
Hackintosh files for the Sony VAIO SVE14A2V1EW - Contains OpenCore files + DSDT patches, kexts, etc.

OSX Catalina running on Sony Vaio SVE14

1366x768 resolution
Files designed for ivy lake configuration with HD4000 IGPU, intel wireless, realtek ethernet.

The main branch is the finished product as far as you go from USB (IE, some post install stuff done)
The 'Bootable / Installable' branch is the end state of the OC folder of the USB to start with.

Hope that helps
